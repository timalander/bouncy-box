# Bouncy Box
### A simple animation using pure JavaScript and HTML/CSS

A single randomly-generated box is placed within the browser window. It's movement is also randomly pre-determined.

Clicking on a box will spawn a new randomly generated box, with its own unique color and speed.

No external JS libraries were use, nor is there any use of WebGL or HTML5 Canvas.
